  <p>I am Olivier Spagnou, passionate about marketing and neurosciences. 

I am graduated ‘summa cum laude’ from the North Carolina State University in business administration with a concentration in marketing. I have a triple diploma with SKEMA Business School and the Université de Lille II. I am currently a student in “Digital Marketing & Data Science” at EM Lyon on the Paris campus

Through my professional experiences, I would like to be specialized in neuromarketing and consumer neurosciences. Everyday news about geopolitics, internal relations, brain discoveries, and news in general passionate me. I want to learn something new each day.

My hobbies are playing guitar, skateboarding, reading, computer designing (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere), environmental actions and collecting trading card games.

For further information about me and my curriculum, I invite you to check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-spagnou-neuromarketing/"> LinkedIn </a>
